I've spent quite some time supporting this program now.
If you use it much, and feel like it, you can send me
some money, or software you've written for the amiga, 
I won't refuse it.

If you happen to develop shareware software for the amiga, 
I would very much like to get a registered version of your
program, whatever it may be.

I don't DEMAND this, mind you. If you don't feel like
it, you are perfectly legitimate in using tracker and not
sending me anything.

Also, you won't get anything better if you do send money.
Let's just say, it acts as an incentive for me to spend
time on tracker and add features/fix bugs. 

This said, my postal address is:
Marc Espie
60 rue du quatre septembre
87100 Limoges
France

I can deal with french francs, or US checks. Anything else you'll
have to try.

	Marc Espie
