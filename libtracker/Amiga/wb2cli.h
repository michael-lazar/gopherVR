******* WB2CLI ***************************************************************
*
*   NAME
*	WB2CLI								(V37)
*
*   SYNOPSIS
*	status = WB2CLI(wbmsg,defaultstack,dosbase)
*	  D0             A0    D0           A1
*
*	LONG WB2CLI(struct WBStartup *,ULONG,struct DosLibrary *)
*
*   FUNCTION
*	This function will take a workbench started application and change
*	it into a CLI-like application.  This will include a path as copied
*	from the Workbench.  The CLI default stack is used to pick the stack
*	size for the processes run as CLIs.  (This is in SYNC mode)
*
*	You would pass in the Workbench message pointer and a pointer
*	to an open dos.library.  (The DosLibrary pointer is used to call
*	dos.library without the need of globals.)
*
*	This *REQUIRES* V37 dos.library and exec.library.
*
*   NOTES
*	Assembly language programmers:  This routine is _WB2CLI
*
*	If you call WB2CLI() and are already a CLI, it will return as if
*	it worked even though it did nothing.  (After all, you were a CLI)
*	For this reason, you do not need to check if you are a CLI
*	started program before you call the function.
*
*	One word of interest:  Once you call this function, the pr_CLI
*	field of your process will *NOT* be NULL.  This is by definition
*	of what this program is trying to do, which is make you like a CLI.
*	You will, however, still need to reply the workbench startup message
*	that you passed to the WB2CLI routine.
*
*	You are, however, responsible for setting up any input or output
*	file handles that you may needed.  Being workbench started means
*	that you have no standard-in or standard-out.  (Just as before)
*	(In other words, this function does not magically give you any
*	I/O as you may already have done so or need a special form of it)
*	These handles are pr_CIS, pr_COS, etc.  For example, many DOS
*	calls may rely on these being valid.  RunCommand() under V37
*	is one such creature.
*
*   EXAMPLE
*	void main(int argc, char *argv[])
*	{
*	struct  DosLibrary  *DOSBase;
*
*	    \* We need V37 to do this *\
*	    if (DOSBase=(struct DosLibrary *)OpenLibrary("dos.library",37L))
*	    {
*		\* Cute trick:  If you are a CLI, WB2CLI is a NO-OP *\
*		\* Thus, you normally don't need to check *\
*	        \* NOTE:  Most of the time you will ignore the error *\
*	        if (WB2CLI((struct WBStartup *)argv,4000,DOSBase))
*	        {
*	            \* We now are workbench started CLI *\
*	            \* (Complete with path *\
*	        }
*	        else
*	        {
*	            \* We did not become a CLI but we still *\
*	            \* can run.  Just not as a CLI *\
*	        }
*
*	        \* More stuff *\
*
*	        CloseLibrary((struct Library *)DOSBase);
*	    }
*	}
*
*   INPUTS
*	wbmsg -- The Workbench message that you were started with.  If NULL
*	         this routine will do nothing...
*
*	defaultstack -- The size of the CLI default stack in bytes.
*	                You *SHOULD* supply a value of at least 4000.
*
*	dosbase -- Pointer to dos.library (must be open)
*
*   RESULTS
*	A magically transformed process that has a CLI structure added.
*
*	status -- Returns TRUE if it worked.  Usually can be ignored
*	          as your program will continue to work as if you did not
*	          call this function.
*
*   SEE ALSO
*	None
