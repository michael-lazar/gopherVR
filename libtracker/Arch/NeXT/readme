This is the NeXTstep port of tracker. It was originally done on m68k
hardware, but other people have tried it on the other NeXTStep platforms
as well (and submitted patches if necessary ;)).

These are the main changes I had to make, in case someone is interested:

* I added support for sgtty ("old" BSD) style terminal settings to Unix/ui.c.
  I have also cleaned this up and made it architecture independent. I have
  verified that it works on Suns, too. See Arch/config.h.sample for the way
  to use it.
* I created a new variable 'play_ahead' that tells how many buffer blocks
  are queued before waiting for the sound to actually play. The buffering 
  is required to ensure continous play, even if the program is not running 
  continously (like when you're actuallay working with the computer ;-)) 
  I could have made the value settable with a command line option, but this
  would be architecture dependent. Instead it uses the environment variable
  BUFFER_BLOCKS right now.
  just defaulted right now.
* Added call to SNDSwapSoundToHost before actually playing the sound, so
  it should work on NS/intel now.
* Because of quite recent changes to the Makefile it should even work with
  NeXT's native make (at least it does for me ;))

I think that's it. If you have any questions, ask away. My email adress is
