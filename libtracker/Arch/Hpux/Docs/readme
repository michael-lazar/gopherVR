Readme for the hp3 port.
-----------------------
[ NOTE: this is still undergoing development, and will probably be
  enhanced, as some parts don't work very well.  ]

     The is a port of tracker, version 3.19, to HP-UX 7x5 machines with
audio devices that can handle 16-bit CD-quality stereo audio.  Tracker
plays Amiga MOD files, which are generally of much higher quality than
most computer music that most people have heard (however, MOD files
still aren't excellent in terms of sound quality -- they are merely
"very good").

     Note that you must have an audio device that supports stereo and
16-bit data.  Other audio output devices are not supported, although
support may be added in the future.

     You also need HP-UX 9.01 to use this program, and you must have set
up audio services on your 7x5 workstation.  See the audio services
manual to see how to set this up.


***** Quickstart instructions:

1. Put these files in some convenient directory.  The tracker binary
   contains no hard-coded paths, and can be placed anywhere.

2. The files whose names end with ".mod" are Amiga "MOD" files, which
   contain instructions on how to play a song.  Each .mod file is one
   song.

3. To play a song to the headphone jack, do (for example):

	tracker -volume -20 -mix 40 boesen.mod

   (You may have to add paths to the tracker binary or to boensen.mod)

   If you want the song to be output to the internal speaker, do:

	tracker -speaker -volume 0 -mix 40 boesen.mod

   IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE A VOLUME LEVEL OF ZERO (0) IF YOU ARE LISTENING
   USING HEADPHONES.  A VOLUME LEVEL OF ZERO IS LOUD, AND COULD
   CONCEIVABLY CAUSE DAMAGE TO YOUR HEARING.  Frankly, you probably
   shouldn't use anything above -5 if you are listening using
   headphones.

4. There are three .mod files in this distribution.  They are among the
   best that I've heard, and represent a wide range of musical tastes:

	boesen.mod	-- Piano (harpsichord???).  Sounds like a
			   barroom piano player.

	crystalh.mod	-- Perhaps the most famous Amiga mod file.  I
			   can't describe this.  A poor description
			   would be a combination between rock and new
			   wave music.

	xmas.mod	-- This sounds like a drunken rock DJ's idea of
			   Christmas Muzak h*ll.  Still, it's quite
			   impressive.


***** Other notes:

1. The volume is specified in dB, and the default volume setting is
   -20dB.  Note that setting the volume to -5dB and higher could
   conceivably cause damage to your hearing if you listen to mod files
   using a headphone.

2. After running tracker, X-Windows (vue) can no longer beep.  I have no
   idea why, although I'm looking into this.
