This is the 1.0 version of ppunpack. It should compile on any Unix
machines with precious little changes.

ppunpack is a small utility, to depack powerpacker files.
PowerPacker is a compressor program written on the Amiga by
Nico Francois, which is sadly non portable. 

This code is copyright (c) Marc Espie, 1995. 
It is loosely based on the original powerpacker decruncher code,
copyright (c) Nico Francois.
Original PowerPacker algorithm by Nico Francois.

THIS SOURCE-CODE CAN BE USED FOR NON COMMERCIAL PURPOSES ONLY,
IN PPDECRUNCH OR TRACKER.

PLEASE CONTACT Nico Francois (nico.francois@scala.com) FOR ANY
OTHER USES.

ppunpack only unpacks PowerPacker data files. It is only intended
as an help for people who have to process Amiga-related files
on other machines, and don't want to download PowerPacked files to
an Amiga, uncompress the file, and upload it to the other machine.

The sf.pp and sf.chk have been provided as a check that ppunpack 
works.
