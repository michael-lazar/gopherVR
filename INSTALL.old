OpenMotif
in gopher: ./configure, then make in gopher/object (you only need
	libgopher.a)

Installing gophervr
-------------------

1) First make sure you have a version of Motif available.  This comes
   with most standard commercial unix systems.  For Linux you can
   use Lesstif (http://www.lesstif.org) without any trouble.  Most linux
   distributions have it.

2) Make sure you have a complete build environment.  That means
   installing any development packages that you may need.  For example on
   linux you might need to install XFree86-devel (for xmkmf) and
   lesstif-devel (for the header files..)

3) You will need an active, built, UMN gopher tree.  GopherVR uses
   this code to fetch resources from the network.

4) Link the gopher tree to the top level of the GopherVR tree.  If
   your gopher source tree was at /home/fred/source/gopher-3_0_1 you would
   execute the following command:

     ln -s /home/fred/source/gopher-3_0_1 gopher

5) Next type 'make' followed by your systemname.  The following systems are
   recognized (but not necessarily tested)

     linux      - most versions of linux
     sol2sparc  - Sun Solaris running a sparc CPU
     sun4       - SunOS 4.x
     irix5      - SGI's old os.  May work for later versions of irix..

6) Once everything is compiled go into the 2nd level gophervr
   directory and type ./gophervr

   You may want to copy the futura.l file to /usr/local/lib if you
   plan to install the gophervr binary.

Enjoy!
