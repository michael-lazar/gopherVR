TurboC users should note that TurboC defines a "poly" routine in "math.h"
and that this sometimes conficts with our definition of "poly" in "vogle.h"

To Build everything using TurboC and TurboC++ (and TASM)

	Go to the top level VOGL directory and type "buildtc"

To use Borland C++ then you will have to edit all the makefile.tc
in the src, examples and hershey/src directories and change "tcc" to "bcc"

Please note that VOGL isn't strictly ANSI C so you will get the odd little
warning messages about functions like main not returning values (we have to
use exit on some other platforms). Just ignore them.
