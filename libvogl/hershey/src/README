	interval for the characters to be used. A pair which has a second
	number of zero is considered to be one character, the number of
	which is given by the first number in the pair.

	creates a binary suitable for use with VOGLE/VOGL in the file name from
	the characters in the Hershey data file.

	as a series of move-draws, with 64 characters to the screen.
