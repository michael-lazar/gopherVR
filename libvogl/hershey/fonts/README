The Oriental Characters.

	The file hersh.or contains over 1000 Kanji, or Chinese characters,
and the Japanese Hiragana and Katakana alphabets.

ASCII sequence translation files:

        The Hershey glyphs, while in a particular order, are not in an
        ASCII sequence. Translation Files are provided that give the
        pairs of glyph numbers that make up a font. Pairs of glyph numbers
	where the second number is zero are considered to define a single
	character represented by the glyph number of the first.

        File names are made up of fffffftt.hmp,

                where ffffff is the font style, one of:
                        roman   Roman
                        greek   Greek (some characters not placed in 
					sequence)
                        italic  Italic
                        script  Script
                        cyril   Cyrillic (some characters not placed in
                                           sequence)
                        gothgr  Gothic German
                        gothgb  Gothic English
                        gothit  Gothic Italian

                and tt is the font type, one of:
                    p       Plain (very small, no lower case)
                    s       Simplex (plain, normal size, no serifs)
                    d       Duplex (normal size, no serifs, doubled lines)
                    c       Complex (normal size, serifs, doubled lines)
                    t       Triplex (normal size, serifs, tripled lines)
                    cs      Complex Small (Complex, smaller than normal size)

	Greek and Cyrillic have had their characters arranged appropriate
	to similar sounding letters in the roman alphabet. This may seem
	a little odd - but it does work rather well - well here anyway!

The following is the mapping of index files to current VOGLE font names:

		astrol.hmp		astrology
		scripts.hmp		cursive
		cyrilc.hmp		cyrillic
		romans.hmp		futura.l
		romand.hmp		futura.m
		gotheng.hmp		gothic.eng

The three sizes are coded with particular base line (bottom of a capital
letter) and cap line (top of a capital letter) values for 'y':

        Size            Base Line       Cap Line

        Very Small         -5              +4 
        Small              -6              +7
        Normal             -9              +12

        (Note: some glyphs in the 'Very Small' fonts are actually 'Small')

The top line and bottom line, which are normally used to define vertical
        spacing, are not given. Maybe somebody can determine appropriate
        values for these!

The left line and right line, which are used to define horizontal spacing,
        are provided with each character in the database.
