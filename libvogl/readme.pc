 Installing on a PC.

a) Copy all the subdirectories from the disk(s) using cpfd.bat
   eg: C:> a:
       A:> cd vogl
       A:> cpfd c:\vogl
       A:> c:

b) If you want MS-Fortran interfaces then from the vogl directory run
   fbuild.bat with your floating point option as an argument.
   eg: C:> cd vogl
       C:> fbuild -FPi87

c) If you don't want MS-Fortran interfaces then run build.bat instead of
   fbuild.bat

d) The above batch files stop in the examples directory. Try and run the
   examples.

e) If The examples worked then put VOGL.LIB and HERSHEY.LIB where you 
   normally put libraries.

   Notes:

       Different devices are compiled in according to the flags in the
       makefiles in the SRC directory.

       Uses the Large memory model ('cause we had to also use MS-Fortran)
