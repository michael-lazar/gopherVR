Installing gophervr
-------------------

GopherVR is currently tested on Mac OS X 10.4-10.10 (PowerPC and Intel),
SGI Irix 6.5 (MIPS), OpenBSD, Arch Linux (x86) and Ubuntu 10.04 (x86).

1) First make sure you have a version of Motif available.  This comes
   with most standard commercial unix systems.  For Linux you can
   use Lesstif (http://www.lesstif.org) without any trouble.  Most Linux
   distributions have it or can get it. Irix has Motif built-in. For OS X, use 

	https://sourceforge.net/projects/openmotif-mac/

   [the 10.5 version works fine on 10.6 and up]).

2) Make sure you have a complete build environment.  That means
   installing any development packages that you may need.  For example, on
   Linux you might need to install XFree86-devel (for xmkmf) and
   lesstif-devel (for the header files); Ubuntu users should install all the
   compiler and printing packages, and your header files.

   For Mac OS X, you need Xcode 2.5 or higher with xcodebuild, and X11.app 
   (separate install for 10.4, included in 10.5 on up). Audio is not yet
   supported. XQuartz (10.6+) also works.

   For Irix 6.5, you need MIPSPro 7.4.4m and associated development headers.
   gcc is not yet supported for Irix. Some features don't work yet on Irix,
   including help and audio.

3) Next type 'make' followed by your architecture.  The following systems are
   recognized and are believed to work:

     macosxu    - Mac OS X 10.4+ (Universal ppc/i386 binary)
		  Your compiler must be capable of building PowerPC binaries.
     macosx11   - Mac OS X 10.4+ (i386) through Yosemite
		  *** NB: x86_64 doesn't work yet and will crash.
		      Also, the motifmaclauncher Xcode project is only
		      supported with Universal builds. PowerPC forever.
     linux      - most versions of Linux (only tested on x86/x86_64)
     irix       - Irix 6.5 (6.5.10+ tested)
     openbsd    - OpenBSD (should work on most arches now)

     These targets are untested and/or experimental.
     cygwin     - Cygwin 1.7+ with gcc and Motif/dev packages
     sol2sparc  - Sun Solaris 2 running on SPARC
     sun4       - SunOS 4.x
     irix5      - Irix 5.x

6) Once everything is compiled go into the 2nd level gophervr
   directory and type ./gophervr (or if you're on a Mac, grab the binary out
   of motifmaclauncher/build/).

   On Linux, copy gophervr.help to /usr/share/doc/gophervr/gophervr.help.

   You may want to copy the futura.hfont to /usr/local/lib/hershey if you
   plan to install the gophervr binary.

Enjoy!
