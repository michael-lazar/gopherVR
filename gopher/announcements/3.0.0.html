    <h1>Gopher Turns 10 / Gopher 3.0 (Furry Terror) Released</h1>
    
    January 8, 2002
    <P>
    The Internet Gopher Server and Curses Client is 10 years old!*
    Since its <A HREF="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=1991Sep10.020238.4751%40cs.umn.edu">announcement</A> in late 1991, Gopher quickly sprang up to be
    one of the most innovative technologies of its time.  Gopher today
      still provides features not found on Web servers -- namely,
      its idea that the entire planet is just one big filesystem.
      Modern browsers such as Konqueror and Mozilla show it to us that
      way, even with drag-and-drop integration with the desktop.
      <P>
      Today we release the Internet Gopher Server and Client version
      3.0.
      <P>
      After having been totally unmodified for five years, the
      Internet Gopher has kicked back to life.  The University of
      Minnesota placed the code under the GNU General Public License
      and an interested group of hackers set to work on it.  A year
      later, we have this release.

    (may have been done earlier anyway)

gopher (2.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial re-release.  Package had been yanked after 1995 due to licensing.
  * UMN has just GPL'd gopher.

    security.
    SIDE EFFECT: logging will not work if chroot() is used.
  * The extension chopping code was buggy, so I have removed it.
  * Made many fixes to eliminate compiler warnings and errors.
  * Removed redefinitions of sys_errlist
  * Included more header files to bring in relevant prototypes
  * Modified to use Debian paths
  * Modified configure.in to look for -lcrypt
  * Modified Makefile.config.in to use -Wall
  * Removed -DSETPROCTITLE from configure.in to make start-stop-daemon
    work better.
  * Added logrotate
  * Wrote Debian support from scratch.
  * AUTH.h includes crypt.h
  * gopherd/Makefile.in uses separate conffile dir (Debian path)
  * STRstring.h had a paren problem; gcc on alpha brought it out.  Fixed.
  * String.h was missing some header files.
  * Other fixes.

</PRE>      

* The exact date of version 1.0 of UMN gopher's release is not logged,
    but this is about the right time.
