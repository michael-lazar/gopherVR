How to install and use Internationalized message strings.
=========================================================

For all systems:
----------------
  If you changed the top-level Makefile.config to be anything but
  /usr/local/lib, you will have to edit all the *.msg files.  Search for a
  line in each starting with 225 (223 for VMS) and if it exists, change the
  directory path on the next 2 lines appropriately.


For X/Open 3 compliant systems:
-------------------------------

Gopher now uses the catopen/catgets calls to read data from message
catalogs.  Installing these can be difficult at times.  Here are a few
hints on getting these message files working.

1) Make the files into binary catalogs using the 'gencat' utility.  If
   you type 'make' in this directory they should automatically generate
   themselves.

2) Now, you need to figure out where to install the files.  Different
   operating systems have different places to put these files.  Some
   like /usr/lib/locales/, others /usr/lib/nls, etc.

   Look at the manual page for catopen() or intro in section 5 of your 
   manual pages for more information.  Specifically look for
   information on the value of the NLSPATH variable.

3) Once you have the files in the correct locations you can use them
   by changing your LANG or LC_MESSAGES environment variable.

   i.e

     LANG=fr    or
     setenv LC_MESSAGES Es
   
   Note that case is significant.  The catopen() routines will most
   likely look in the following location for it's cat file in:

    {NLSLIB}/{lang}/LC_MESSAGES/gopher.cat

   NLSLIB is defined as your OS specific languages directory, where
   {lang} is the value of the LC_MESSAGES environment variable or the
   LANG variable

   Other systems put these files in different locations.  Consult your
   manual pages for more information.


What to do if it just won't work
--------------------------------

On some systems you need to have the right files loaded to do NLS
commands.  The call to setlocale() will fail if you don't have the
proper files in the /usr/lib/nls directory.  Don't worry though, we
provide a backup for such a circumstance.

By typing 'make install' you will make a gophernls directory that
contains all of the message catalogs.  If the gopher client cannot
find the message catalog the regular way, it will try these backup
files.   So, if you wanted to use the spanish gopher, do
  
  setenv LC_MESSAGES Es

before running the gopher client.  This should work on most other
systems. 

For non-X/Open 3 compliant systems:
-----------------------------------
make install-msgs should install the files properly.

To use them set the environment variables LANG or LC_MESSAGES to
the name of the message file without the suffix, i.e.
	setenv LC_MESSAGES Es_ES
if you want a spanish speaking gopher.


Customizing Gopher for your Particular Locale
=============================================

Basically start with one of the files and convert from it.  You might
want to start with the En_US.msg, since this is the list of original
english messages.

Then give it a name (use your iso language code) and send it to the
gopher team for the next release.

Thanks!
