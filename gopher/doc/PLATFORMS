These are the platforms on which gopher is known to work.

Gopher should also work on any Unix/Posix platform (Solaris, SunOS, *BSD,
Linux, MacOS X, etc).  Please let us know if you have troubles compiling or
running gopher on your platform by e-mailing gopher@complete.org.

The second column in the list below indicates the latest version of gopher
that someone has reported about.

Thanks!

-----------

If you want to use gopher on older platforms (VMS, Ultrix, etc), please
check out the UMN gopher 2.3.1 distribution.  Gopher 3 is not currently
supporting VMS, though we have not removed the VMS support from the tree. 
(VMS hackers: help us out!)

 ** Special notes for Mac OS X / Darwin:

Darwin appears to have some compatibility problems.  Note that you must have
the developer pack installed to build gopher.  You must also use gnumake
instead of make.

Now here's the kicker -- If you are building on a HFS+ partition rather than
a UFS one, the case-insensitivity in the operating system can cause
problems.  Build instead on a UFS partition.  You can try this by using the
Disk Copy tool to create a UFS playground within your HFS partition.  Untar
the gopher source tree on this UFS volume and build it there.  Clint Paden
<clint.paden@vanderbilt.edu> reports that this will work.
